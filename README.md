# Research-on-Autonomous-Decision-Making-Agents-Based-on-Various-Deep-DQN-Architectures
This work is the final project for the Advanced ML course at the University of Lincoln. In this work, I implemented and compared five DQN-based agents with different network architectures for autonomous Super Mario Bros gameplay, including Nature DQN (CNN), Nature DQN (RNN), Nature DQN (Transformer), Double DQN ([From the PyTorch official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/mario_rl_tutorial.html)), and Dueling DQN. More details about it, please check https://xumingaogithub.github.io/AML/.
