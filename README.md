# Research-on-Autonomous-Decision-Making-Agents-Based-on-Various-Deep-DQN-Architectures
This work is the final project for the Advanced ML course at the University of Lincoln. In this work, I implemented and compared five DQN-based agents with different network architectures for autonomous Super Mario Bros gameplay.
